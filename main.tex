\section{Introduction}

We are the Dodecahedron Improv Theater (DIT) group, a non-profit group of students and young professionals from different paths of life who gather on a weekly basis to learn and rehearse theater improvisation. Our group was brought to life in July 2017. We meet on weekly basis for rehearsals at ETH ZÃ¼rich zentrum, usually on Wednesdays. One can find more updated information about us in our \href{https://www.facebook.com/dodecahedronimprovtheater/}{Facebook page}.

In occasions the audience will provide some aspect of the story to be told that will guide the improvisers, for example a relationship between characters, the place will the action will take place or a general idea that shall be translated into a plot.
